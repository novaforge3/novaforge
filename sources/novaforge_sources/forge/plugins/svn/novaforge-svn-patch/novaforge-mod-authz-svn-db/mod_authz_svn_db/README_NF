The source code of the mod_authz_svn_db has been modified in order to add an Apache Directive just to know if the module is active or not.
This directive is :

* AuthzSVNDBIsActive	<On|Off>
	Optional
	Default: 			Off
	Description:	    If enabled, mod_authz_svn_db will be active.
	Notes:				This allow to use in the same apache vhost differents tools without having error logs about bad module configuration.
	Warnings:			None
	
To compile this module, you need to be on the target system (Centos5 x86_64) and to install the following packages :
- gcc
- mysql-devel
- httpd-devel
- subversion-devel
- mod_dav_svn

To compile it :
- go to the mysql directory.
- enter the following compilation line :
apxs -c -I/usr/include/subversion-1 -I.. -L/usr/lib64/mysql -lmysqlclient mod_authz_svn_db_mysql.c

- to build and install the final DSO :
apxs -ie -n authz_svn_db_mysql_module mod_authz_svn_db_mysql.la

the library mod_authz_svn_db_mysql.so will be installed in:
/usr/lib64/httpd/modules

There is no automatic assembly and installation. you need to copy the DSO in the packaging if you make any modification in sources.
