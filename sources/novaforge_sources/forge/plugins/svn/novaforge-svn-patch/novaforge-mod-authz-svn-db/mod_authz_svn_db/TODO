This is the list of known issues that need to be completed with the
authz_svn_db module:

 * Buffer overrun protections (these are probably necessary, I just need
time to think of where they can occur)
 * Write/Finish SQL statement in the README
 * Write the configuration of subversion repositories in the README (the
 tutorial/walkthrough)
 * Enumerate the apache directives in the README
 * pkg-config the pgsql module makefile/make platform independent as much
 as possible.
 * Explain the SQL database schema in README.
 * Create some examples customizing the Apache Directives in README.
 * Figure out why Postgres doesn't care about passwords
 * Test to see if passwords are used and accessible to the sub-modules
