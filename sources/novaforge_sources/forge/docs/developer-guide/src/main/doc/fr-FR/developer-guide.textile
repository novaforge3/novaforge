Use of workspace mechanic


h2. Importing preferences sets

p. Team project sets are also declared in @eclise/working-sets@ under "https://novaforge7.bull.fr/svn/nfsafran/conventions":https://novaforge7.bull.fr/svn/nfsafran/conventions. Team project sets enable you to checkout the code but also to configure your workspace with pre-defined working sets which help to classify projects.

p. First of all, you need at least to configure the NovaForge(tm) SVN repository ("https://novaforge7.bull.fr/svn/nfsafran/":https://novaforge7.bull.fr/svn/nfsafran/) in order to configure your credentials you have on this repository. Then, you need to checkout the files under the folder @eclipse/working-sets@ of @conventions@ (browse the svn directory to get the exact path).

Once the files checked out, go to the menu *File -> Import...*.
