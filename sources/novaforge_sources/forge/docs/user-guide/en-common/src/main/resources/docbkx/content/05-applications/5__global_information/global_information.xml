		<title>Ineffective button from the integrated application</title>

		<para>For some applications, the action to clic on one of the displayed buttons from NovaForge Portal 
    doesn't lead to the expected result.
		</para>
    
    <para>For example, for Nexus application, a clic on the "Add" button available in the "Scheduled Tasks" administration menu 
    does not trigger the display of the related contextual menu.
		</para>
    
    <para>The workaround to this issue consists in performing this action from a page opened in a new tab.
    In the above example, you just have to clic, with the mouse right button, on the "Scheduled Tasks" menu and to then select 
    the option "Open the link in a new tab" in the contextual menu.  
    </para>

		<para>This dysfunction has been observed on several applications.
