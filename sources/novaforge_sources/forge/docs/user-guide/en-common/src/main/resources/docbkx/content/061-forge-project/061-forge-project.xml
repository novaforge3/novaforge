  <title>Managing the Forge project</title>

	<para>In Novaforge, there are two special spaces: the Forge project and
		the Forge repository. This chapter describes the purpose of the Forge
		project and how to manage it.</para>

	<sect1>
		<title>Purpose of the Forge project</title>

		<para>The purpose of the Forge project is to share information and
			applications for all forge users. By default, all forge users are
			members of this project.</para>

		<para>The simplest case of use is sharing of information (good
			practices, technical wiki) within a company. For example, we could
			easily consider giving a wiki or a document management application to
			all forge users.</para>
	</sect1>

	<sect1>
		<title>Administrating the Forge project</title>

		<para>From the technical point of view, the forge project is a project
			just like the others. It can only be administrated by administrators
			of this project of the forge administrator via the menu <emphasis role="bold"> Project administration/The forge project".</emphasis></para>
