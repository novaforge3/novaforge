	<title>Managing your Documents with Alfresco</title>

	<para>Alfresco is an open source documentary management tool (GED). It

		them, change their format, manage access rights and authorizations,
		enter their metadata, etc.</para>

	<para>We will not reproduce the Alfresco documentation here, but simply
		explain how to configure one way of accessing documents which users
		may find useful: webdav mode.</para>

	<section>
		<title>Configuring your webdav access</title>

		<para>The WebDav (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning)
			protocol is used to retrieve, submit, synchronize and publish files
			and folders on remote machines. It therefore allows several users to
			publish a file simultaneously by temporarily blocking its access
			during the operation. </para>

		<para>Via WebDAV, NovaForgeTM allows you to create a connection with
			the project document repository in order to publish, create, rename
			and delete files of folders. To do this, a WebDav connection must be
			configured on your workstation. This procedure is described below.
		</para>

		<para>After configuring the connection, you will be able to navigate
			through the project document repository using your WebDav client
			explorer. This will enable you in particular to easily create a file
			hierarchy or handle your files by click/drag. </para>

		<para>Important: We strongly recommend that you do not edit files
			directly from the WebDav client. In the event of a communication
			failure between your workstation and NovaForgeTM, you could lose data
			concerning the current work. To edit a file, you are recommended to
			copy it into your local repository and publish the new document
			version after making the change. </para>

		<orderedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>Give a right click on the Workstation icon. Now choose the Map
					Network Drive option and choose the Sign up for online storage
					option.</para>

					to access the documents of all projects that the user is entitled
