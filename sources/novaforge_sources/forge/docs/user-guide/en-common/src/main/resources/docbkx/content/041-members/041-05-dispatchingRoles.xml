  <title>Roles dispatching</title>
  
  <para>A role is used in some cases for the propagation of users on project tools during the mapping roles.</para>
  <para>The use of multiple roles on the project tools is not possible, they do not permit it in many cases. therefore the system use the prioritary role among all roles owned by the user on the forge to determine the role that the user will have in the tool.</para>
  <para>Project roles are ordered. This allows to define which role is prioritary over any other. Thus the selection of role to be used on a tool is made ​​according to this hierarchy.</para>
   <para>If a user has multiple roles, the project administrator can define the role to use as a prioritary during the propagation of role. This will be used if an existing mapping is with the tool.
