	<title>Managing applications</title>

	<para>
		Once the project has been validated by the forge administrator, the
		user who created the project can access it in order to manage it. This
		section explains how to add a technical event management application
		(Mantis). Simply go to the project navigation menu and choose
		<emphasis role="bold">Project administration.</emphasis>

		<para>
			<emphasis role="bold">Remark : it is possible that when creating an
				application, the project creation in the tool fails, for example if
				the tool is no longer available. In this case, the application will
				end up in error and will not be operational. The user can send a
				mail to the forge administrator to alert him about the problem.

		<title>Sonar and Jenkins applications management</title>
		<para>
			Applications continuous integration (Jenkins) and quality metrics
			(Sonar) have the distinction of being partitioned on instances of
			dedicated tools for each project. A number of instances Sonar and
			Jenkins are provided at the start of the Forge and will provision the
			first building applications.
			It is possible that the provisioning threshold procurement of Jenkins
			or Sonar instances is reached and the creation of an application
			Sonar or Jenkins becomes awaiting supply.
			In this case, the application will be created with a status
			<db:emphasis> Creation pending </db:emphasis>
			and will not be operational (no link in the navigation project) as
			the instance of the tool Sonar or Jenkins is created.

		<title>Inter-tool association</title>

		<para>The forge provides an inter-tool communication mechanism in
			order to exchange information between two applications within a
			project. To understand the configuration of this type of association,
			we will take the example of two applications, Mantis and Testlink.
			The scenario is as follows: when a functional test fails, Testlink
			sends a notification to Mantis to automatically create a bug
			associated with the failure. Proceed as follows:</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Go to the
					<emphasis role="bold">Your applications tab and select <emphasis role="bold">Mantis</emphasis> application
